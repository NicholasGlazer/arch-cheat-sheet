# Preliminaries
<a id="preliminaries"></a>
```sh
    "You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."
                                                                                         â€•Morpheus
```

Now I have two pills for you.
Use blue pill and you will forget everything I said and continue to live happy with your desktop environments, with choices they've made.
Or maybe you are a brave soul which desire to learn new things and make choices according to your preferences.
The state in which I see Linux is [the anarchy state] on the first place, because, you see it's a philosophical idea, that you need to take responsibility for every custom component in your system.
And the thing why I love distributions like Arch Linux, are because you become responsible for all your interaction starting from the bare shell.
 This way you can learn much more then just clicking mouse on windows installer, which I hate, it's not flexible at all, it thinks that I'm stupid and can't properly configure hardware interaction configurations,

As an example, think of Microsoft installation process -[the EFI resizing after the dual-boot](/environment/efi-resizing) is even present here.


::: tip
Wise idea will be to take a look at [Arch general recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/General_recommendations).
:::

If you are not a big fan of heavy desktop environment like me and want everything to be done in a custom way, to have full control over your system!
Follow my steps with the dotfiles and [no desktop environment way](/environment/no-desktop-environment)

## Establish internet connection
<a id="esteblish_internet_connection"></a>
Since [#iwd](/environment/iwd) was installed with [#pacstrap =>](/core/base-files#pacstrap).
In order to use it we must enable the service, find the device and connect to the wi-fi network. [See iwd =>](/environment/iwd)

<a id="dotfiles"></a>
It could be very useful to collect your configs in one place, usually people call them dotfiles.   

## Dotfiles + git
<a id="dotfiles-git"></a>

Since [#git](/environment/git) was installed with [#pacstrap =>](/core/base-files#pacstrap).
To learn the best way so far to manage your dotfiles repository as a [--bare](/environment/git#git-bare).
See my article [the best way to manage dotfiles =>](/environment/dotfiles)
