# Package management
The collection of package-managers that I'm using heavily or used in the past.
## Arch
<a id="Arch"></a>
AUR(Arch User Repository) - Is the place where you can find all variety of linux packages, and their git versions.
You can read more about [Arch User Repository on archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).
Or you might want to check AUR wrappers like [#yay =>](/core/general#aur-wrapper), which I used to use for a while.
You can look at [AUR helpers comparison table on archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers#Comparison_table).
### pacman
I see no reason to use any other package managers for AUR except pacman, despite that I used to use yay heavily for several years.

## Nix
Read more about [#nix =>](/environment/nix)

## JS

### NPM
```sh
```
### Yarn
```sh
sudo pacman -S
```
